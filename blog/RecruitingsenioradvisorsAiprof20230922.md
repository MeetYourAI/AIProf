# We Are Recruiting Senior Advisors

I have found the tech incubator model is not widely understood - as always when you are buried in Summate you think everyone else is too! All the potential senior advisors I have spoken to have similar questions. So I am proposing a simpler route:

- **Tech Incubator Definition:** Tech incubator simply means creating lots of tech products with young teams that are innovative but need senior guidance.

- **Product Prototypes:** Best if I send you a link to a website to the product prototypes relevant to your area - [Product Prototypes](https://meetyourai.github.io/AIProf/). We may end up combining these two. As you can see, it's just a webpage half-finished describing the concept. We are building the backend to connect. Should be ready in the coming weeks. When working, you can see how companies can use these tools to create rough content ideas for their marketing. Then their content experts can fine-tune. Make more sense?

- **Senior Advisor Role:** Senior advisor role = guide young team targeting a sector or vertical you know (e.g., marketing agencies). Pretend you are the client and critique. They fast improve.

- **Compensation:** Senior advisors get mates day rates for now more lately. Also, opportunity to own % slice of successful products if that’s attractive.

- **Flexible Work:** Work is done from your mobile phone in pockets of time. You fill in timesheet we pay end of month like normal. Test period to check we all get on OK.

- **Our Product Offerings:** 
   1. Free funded by affiliate ads.
   2. Premium where the customer needs something very specific (AI backend needs to be retrained for this we know how to do). We also want to do this free for charities and good causes cost paid by sponsors and maybe donors. We aim to have a CIC charity-orientated arm.
   3. Custom = TBC i.e., bigger projects.

- **Recommendations:** If you’re too busy, we welcome recommendations for trusted friends and family. We ask only recommend those you rate, as that’s why I have kept in touch with you.
