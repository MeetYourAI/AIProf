                        2.6 From time to time, we may collect or ask you to provide personal information including (without limitation) the following: your name, mobile phone number, email address, password, IP address, unique device identifiers and other identification credentials, biographical details, photographs and/or payment information.

                        2.7 As part of the Services, we may provide functionality allowing you to search for friends by using your Facebook credentials, and, when you elect to do this, you will be asked to allow the Play2Work World Dao access to certain information associated with your Facebook account such as your name, profile picture, gender and list of friends. Provided you consent to this, such information will be processed by us to identify your Facebook friends who are users of the Play2Work World DAO and to allow you to invite those Facebook friends to install the Play2Work World DAO App.

You may turn location monitoring on and off from time to time using the settings of the operating system of your mobile device but, if you disable this functionality, we will not be able to collect information relating to your step-count and GPS/Cell-ID location which will prevent tracking and/or conversion of your movement into Play2Work World DAO.

                        6.2 We use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Play2Work World DAO App and Play2Work World DAO Website(s) and obtain certain information about your usage and behavior. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer when you use the Play2Work World DAO App or Play2Work World DAO Website(s). This helps us to provide you with a better experience when you use the Play2Work World DAO App or browse the Play2WORK World DAO website(s) and also allows us to improve the Services. We will use both persistent cookies, which could remain on your device until their expiration (which, in some cases, is up to 10 years), and session cookies, which are temporary files removed from your device once your browser is closed. <br>

                        • Analytical/Tracking Cookies, which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and analyze the use of the Services, as well as to verify transactions; and <br>

These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.
